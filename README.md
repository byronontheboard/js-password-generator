# js-password-generator (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ 

Originally, I began coding this project as an assignment from UC Davis’s Coding Bootcamp, but soon turned more so into a personal goal of mine: solely to practice the mechanics and concepts that I have learned so far regarding Javascript.

## With this web application, the user will be able to generate their own randomized password under the following criteria: 
- Selecting  a password length between 8-128 characters.
- Selecting which of the following character types to use in their password:
    - Lowercase Characters
    - Uppercase Characters
    - Numeric Characters
    - Special Characters

## Let’s Generate Your Password

### In order to use this application, please find your way to my password generator by clicking this link first:
 [Deployed GitHub IO: JavaScript Password Generator](https://byronontheboard.github.io/js-password-generator/)

Once you have opened the web application, we can now get started. 

First, please click on the ‘Generate Password’ button, from there you will be prompted to select a length for your password(but be sure to enter a length between 8-128 characters in order for the function to continue).

If you select a password length that is not a less than 8, more than 128, or not a number; the application will then return an error message to the user and terminate the function.
